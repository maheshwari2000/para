		<h2>How this started</h2>
		I remembered it was the lecture of END where our birth dates make us come closer for the first time.
		Then I texted you and we talked for a whole day where we came more closer and then it gradually increased day by day and it's proof is here in front of us in our chats, in our phone calls, in our video calls. I hope it remains same.

		<h2>Our Physical Journey</h2>
		Chappan was the place where we meeted for the very first time and I know I did lots of mistake there, SORRY for that but you know I was so shy at that time.
		Then after this we used to go many places for having food and yes ofcourse our MOVIE thing.
		Just think how crazy is that we used to maintain a proper list of places and movies which we have completed and remaining which are yet to be explored.

		<h2>So much things to tell</h2>
		I never had a thought that I will find my girl in college, it was ARDOR where we felt in whole different way for each other and after which I was 100% sure that- "YES! this is my girl".
		After so many days and months we are here with each other just like same caring for each other, respecting each other, fighting with and for each other and ofcourse loving each other more and more.
		I just want to say that I always want to be on this journey with you forever!!!
